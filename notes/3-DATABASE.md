# Database:-

# mongoose.connect()  -> returns a Promise

# First our application should be connected to our database, & then, it should listen to requests.

# First, we need to create schema, then we need to create model. 

# Model name should start with "capital letter".

# Whenever we are interacting with database, use async-await && try-catch
